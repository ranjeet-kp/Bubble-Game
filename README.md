<h1>🎈Bubble Game</h1>

Bubble Game is a fun and interactive project where players pop bubbles, score points, and improve their reaction speed.
This project is designed to help beginners understand basic game development concepts such as DOM manipulation, events, timers, and animation.

<h2>🎮 About the Game</h2>

The game generates bubbles on the screen, and the player must click/tap the correct bubbles before they disappear or before the timer runs out.
Depending on your version of the game, the logic may include:

<ul>
  <li>Clicking the bubble with a target number</li>
  <li>Popping as many bubbles as possible</li>
  <li>Avoiding certain bubbles</li>
  <li>Beating a countdown timer</li>
</ul>

The project provides a simple foundation that can be expanded into more advanced game mechanics.

<h2>✨ Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Smooth and responsive bubble animations</li>
  <li>Score tracking</li>
  <li>Timer countdown</li>
  <li>Random bubble generation</li>
  <li>User-friendly interface</li>
  <li>Beginner-friendly code</li>
</ul>

<h2>🛠️ Tech Stack</h2>

You can customize this based on your real project.
For now, here’s a generic version:

<ul>
  <li>HTML5 – Game structure</li>
  <li>CSS3 – Styling and animations</li>
